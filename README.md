### What it does

NEAR-SIGHTED is a cutting-edge healthcare data privacy solution built on the **Calimero - Data Privacy Bounties** and **Calimero Privacy Track**. By integrating with Calimero's comprehensive framework, NEAR-SIGHTED facilitates the development of self-sovereign applications that prioritize data privacy and security in healthcare. At its core, NEAR-SIGHTED utilizes **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** to enable secure and private data sharing among healthcare stakeholders. This implementation allows healthcare providers to verify and validate patient information without exposing the actual data, effectively addressing the challenges of privacy and trust in data transactions.

**Key Technical Implementations:**

1. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**:
   - By employing ZKPs, NEAR-SIGHTED ensures that sensitive health information can be authenticated without being revealed. For instance, a healthcare provider can verify that a patient meets certain criteria (e.g., age or medical history) without accessing the patient's entire medical record.
   - This is achieved using cryptographic algorithms that generate a proof that can be validated by a verifier, ensuring that only the necessary information is disclosed during a transaction.

2. **Calimero Framework**:
   - NEAR-SIGHTED is built on Calimero’s infrastructure, which provides tools and protocols for building self-sovereign applications. This framework supports data privacy through decentralized identity management, allowing patients to control their own data while enabling healthcare providers to access the necessary information for treatment.
   - The Calimero SDK facilitates the integration of ZKPs into healthcare applications, allowing developers to easily implement privacy-preserving features.

3. **Blockchain Integration**:
   - The solution leverages the **NEAR Protocol** for its blockchain infrastructure, known for its scalability and low transaction costs. This ensures that NEAR-SIGHTED can handle a high volume of transactions typical in the healthcare sector, all while maintaining secure and efficient operations.
   - Transactions related to data sharing are recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and auditable history of interactions while protecting sensitive patient information.

4. **Interoperability**:
   - NEAR-SIGHTED promotes interoperability between different healthcare systems and applications by utilizing standardized data formats and APIs. This allows for seamless integration with existing healthcare infrastructure and enhances collaboration across various stakeholders in the ecosystem.

**Key Features:**

- **Patient-Controlled Data**: Patients retain full control over who accesses their data, enabling them to grant or revoke access as needed.
  
- **Auditable Transactions**: All data-sharing actions are recorded on the blockchain, allowing for traceability without revealing sensitive information. This audit trail can be used to monitor compliance with privacy regulations.

- **Enhanced Security**: Advanced cryptographic techniques ensure that data remains secure both in transit and at rest, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches.

- **Granular Access Controls**: Healthcare providers can set fine-grained permissions, allowing for tailored access to patient data based on specific needs and roles.

- **Scalable Architecture**: Built on the NEAR Protocol, NEAR-SIGHTED is designed to scale efficiently, accommodating increasing numbers of users and data without sacrificing performance.

- **Real-Time Data Sharing**: Facilitates real-time data sharing among healthcare providers, improving patient care and coordination while maintaining privacy.

- **Regulatory Compliance**: NEAR-SIGHTED is designed with compliance in mind, ensuring adherence to healthcare regulations like HIPAA, thereby protecting patient rights and privacy.

Through these technical implementations and key features, NEAR-SIGHTED effectively addresses the pressing need for secure and private data sharing in the healthcare industry, enabling stakeholders to maintain trust while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.



### How we built it
The NEAR-SIGHTED platform is built on the **Calimero Network**, which provides a robust framework for developing self-sovereign applications with a focus on data privacy. We implemented ZKPs using the **ZoKrates** toolkit, allowing us to create proofs for various healthcare data operations.

**Code Example: Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation with ZoKrates**

```javascript
// Example code snippet for generating a proof using ZoKrates
import { initialize, compile, setup, computeWitness, generateProof } from 'zokrates-js';

// Initialize ZoKrates
const zokratesProvider = await initialize();

// Compile the program
const program = `
def main(private field x, private field y) -> (field):
    return x * y
`;
const compiledProgram = await compile(zokratesProvider, program);

// Setup
const { pk, vk } = await setup(zokratesProvider, compiledProgram);

// Compute Witness
const witness = await computeWitness(zokratesProvider, compiledProgram, [4, 3]);

// Generate Proof
const proof = await generateProof(zokratesProvider, pk, witness);
```
