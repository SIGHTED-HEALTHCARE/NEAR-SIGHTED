Secure Medical Records Sharing : A healthcare application that enables the secure and private sharing of medical records between patients and healthcare providers, using Calimero for privacy-preserving access.


### 1. **Bridging Fungible Tokens (bridging-fts)**
   - **Purpose**: This module allows the transfer of fungible tokens between the NEAR blockchain and Calimero shards.
   - **Application in SIGHTED**:
     - **Incentivizing Participation**: You can use fungible tokens as incentives for patients and healthcare providers to participate in the secure medical records sharing system. For example, patients could earn tokens for sharing their data securely or for participating in health studies.
     - **Payment for Services**: Allowing healthcare providers to receive payments in tokens for services rendered can streamline billing processes and enhance trust between patients and providers.
     - **Access Control**: You can implement a token-based access control mechanism where patients need to hold a specific token to grant healthcare providers access to their medical records, ensuring that only authorized personnel can view sensitive information.

### 2. **Calimero Login UI (calimero-login/ui)**
   - **Purpose**: This component provides a user interface for users to log into the Calimero platform using their wallets.
   - **Application in SIGHTED**:
     - **Secure Authentication**: The login UI allows patients and healthcare providers to securely authenticate their identities using blockchain wallets. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access to medical records.
     - **User-Friendly Experience**: A well-designed login interface can enhance user experience, making it easy for users to access their medical records without complicated processes.
     - **Integration with Decentralized Identity**: By leveraging the Calimero login, you can implement decentralized identity solutions that give users more control over their personal data and who can access it.

### 3. **Voting**
   - **Purpose**: This example demonstrates how to create a poll voting mechanism on the blockchain.
   - **Application in SIGHTED**:
     - **Consent Management**: You can use a voting system to allow patients to give consent for specific uses of their medical data. For example, patients could vote on whether to share their data for research purposes or with specific healthcare providers.
     - **Feedback Collection**: The voting mechanism can also be used to collect feedback from patients about their experiences with the SIGHTED platform, helping to improve services based on user input.
     - **Decision-Making Processes**: In a collaborative healthcare environment, voting can facilitate collective decision-making among healthcare providers when it comes to patient care strategies or treatment plans.
